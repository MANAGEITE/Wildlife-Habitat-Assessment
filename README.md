# Wildlife Habitat Assessment Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate and analyze various wildlife habitats to understand the impacts of environmental changes, urban development, and conservation efforts. By integrating data from satellite imagery, on-ground surveys, and historical records, we aim to provide insights into habitat conditions, species diversity, and conservation priorities.

## Objectives

- To assess the quality and extent of wildlife habitats across different regions.
- To identify factors contributing to habitat degradation or improvement.
- To contribute to conservation strategies by providing data-driven insights.

## Methodology

We employ a multidisciplinary approach, combining remote sensing, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), and ecological fieldwork. Our methodology includes:
- Satellite image analysis for land cover and habitat changes.
- GIS mapping of critical habitats and biodiversity hotspots.
- Field surveys for ground-truthing and species inventory.

## Data Sources

- [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)
- [eBird](https://ebird.org/home)
- Satellite data providers (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel)

## Tools and Technologies

- QGIS for GIS data analysis and visualization.
- R and Python for data processing and statistical analysis.
- Machine learning frameworks for habitat suitability modeling.
